1) Colab runtime settings
Open Google Colab → Runtime → Change runtime type → select GPU.
Recommended GPUs: A100 / T4 / V100 (A100 best). If using Colab Pro, choose A100 if available.
 Enable high-RAM runtime if you have very large files.

2) Get Hugging Face token
Go to https://huggingface.co
 → Settings → Access Tokens → create a token (write/read).
In Colab, set it one of these ways:
1)Option A (recommended, interactive):
!pip install -q huggingface_hub
from huggingface_hub import login
login()   # paste token into prompt

2)Option B (env var):
import os
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "hf_xxxYOURTOKENxxx"   # avoid leaving this in shared notebooks

3) Upload your reference audio & test text
Drop your voice sample into Colab (name it reference.mp3 or reference.wav) or run:
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()   # choose reference.mp3
